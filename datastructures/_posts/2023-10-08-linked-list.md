title: building then using a singly-linked list
categories: [data structures and algorithms]

One of the first problems that I encountered in my introduction to computer programming class was trying to add another element to an array which was already full.  This caused the compiler to print an error message.  At the time, I worked around the issue by replacing the full array with an array which was double the size and move all the elements over from the smaller, old array to the larger array.  However, my professor mentioned that after a while, the array will become too large and copying the elements would be much slower than adding the elements to something that wasn't fixed in size.  This is when they introduced the data structure, the singly-linked list.  So today, I was thinking of building a singly-linked list and using the list to build travel iterneraries.  Hopefully, by the end of this, singly-linked lists will be a lot more easier to navigate.
